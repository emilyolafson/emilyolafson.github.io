    <p><big> Too much mindfulness? </big></p>

    <p> As someone who has always believed that their life would improve dramatically if only they could find the self-discipline to sit down and meditate for 10 goddamn minutes a day, I was shocked and somewhat amused to read a blog post about the <a href="https://danlawton.substack.com/p/when-buddhism-goes-bad">dangers of too much mindfulness</a>. In it, Dan Lawton documents his experience meditating so deeply that he descended into a ‘hellscape of terror, panic and paranoia,’ an episode so traumatic that it left him with PTSD and a rightful sense of betrayal from the meditation community. How could this happen? I was really banking on Nirvana being more welcoming.</p>
    <p> As it turns out, there’s an upper limit to the benefits you can extract from meditation and mindfulness before you start seeing “side effects”. On his quest for answers, Lawton discovered the recent work of Dr. Willoughby Britton, a psychologist at Brown, who has been warning of the potential dangers of mindfulness for the past decade. She runs “First Do No Harm” trainings for meditation retreat centers, which I can’t imagine is very good PR for them. </p>
    <p>Her work outlines primarily the domains of mindfulness-related practices and how certain people may actually be harmed by taking these on, depending on their baseline psychological characteristics. For instance, interoception, or awareness of the internal body state, is a mindfulness-related skill thought to confer the most benefits from mindfulness (Mehling et al., 2012). Increased interoception resulting from mindfulness has been linked to increases in the activation and cortical thickness of the insular cortex, the primary hub for interoception. Britton points out that increased awareness of your body’s internal sensations is not necessarily a good thing. Are we really recommending everyone should be more in tune with their body’s sensations of hunger, chronic pain, panic? What is the limit? Heightened awareness of arousal is believed to underlie some panic disorders (Clack 1986). Anecdotally, I wouldn’t want to be more in tune with my body’s alertness after I drink too much coffee.</p>    
    <p>For instance, someone who copes by numbing out their emotions might not benefit from further distance between their awareness and their feelings. On the other hand, someone who over-identifies with their emotions to the point of getting lost in them might stand to gain from these detachment techniques.</p>
   <p> I like the idea that mindfulness/meditation should be prescribed to meet a person's needs, and is not a 'cure-all' for everyone. Like, if you're already feeling detached from your emotions, maybe putting more distance between your awareness and your thoughts is not a good thing, and likewise for high baseline self-awareness.</p>
   <p> The story makes me realize that mindfulness & meditation is just another market filled with people who are looking to make a profit, and perhaps there should be more filtering of who would actually benefit from meditation/mindfulness retreats in the way that psychedelic therapies screen against people with family histories of psychosis. </p>
    <p> The major take home for me was that balance, or the 'middle way', as the author puts it, might be the only thing to strive for.</p>
