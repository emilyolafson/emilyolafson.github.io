# Noodle the Bones Dog Just Dropped Merch

    <p> TikTok has silently and forcefully sucked me in. For those who have avoided its gravitational pull, TikTok is an app where you’re shown videos ranging from 15 seconds to 3 minutes. If you don’t like a video, you can keep scrolling. But TikTok will remember. It uses the length of time spent watching a video and your engagement with the video (whether you liked it, or commented) to train its algorithm that predicts, essentially, you. The speed and accuracy of the algorithm is borderline disturbing. Somehow, within hours of using the app, TikTok had me pegged: I was a left-leaning 20-something year old white woman who works in a STEM field and likes dogs, Bo Burnham, and non-fiction books written by women. Compared to the targeted ads I get on Instagram, TikTok is leagues ahead:</p>

    <p> It’s easy to lose hours to TikTok. If you’re looking to avoid the possibility of having a single thought, TikTok provides. The range of emotions elicited from 1 hour of watching TikTok exceeds anything I’ve experienced on other social media sites. One moment I’m enraged, watching a woman document the state of her home as it falls into disarray when she stops picking up after her husband (#wifestrike). Then, I’m giggling watching my favorite comedian talk about how 3 Mike’s Hard Lemonades is stronger than any psychedelic you can buy. Eventually, I’ll stumble upon a devastating video of an old dog’s final days before euthanasia. It’s psychotic.  </p>
    <p> Recently, a man went viral for posting daily videos of his senile pug immediately after lifting him out of bed. If the pug keeps himself upright after he’s released, he “has bones,” and “it’s a bones day”. A bones day is an exceptionally good omen; you should treat yourself to that thing you’ve been eyeing, ask for the raise, take the risk. If the pug slumps back into his bed, then it’s a no-bones day, folks.  Time for self-care, take it easy, don’t rush into anything. This horoscope for the new millennia has gripped Twitter as well, with accounts popping up to announce to the world whether it’s a bones or no bones day. </p>

    <p> This is the death rattle of a society in decline.  </p>
    <p> I’m kidding, of course. I love a good internet phenomenon that unites the masses in silliness. But what does it mean that this guy’s first instinct is to make merchandise, and we’re all like, yup! Only logical next step! </p>

    <div style="clear: both"></div>
    <p>The mask costs $25 by the way. Part of me wonders whether this will be seen by even a fraction of the internet. Does my conservative aunt know about bones? Will I remember bones in 3 years? Do you think the Romans had an equivalent of this? At least they had chariot races. All the technology of the 21st century, and we’re enthralled by whether some pug on his deathbed gives life one more shot?  </p>
    <p>With amplification algorithms tuned to maximize engagement for the sake of beefing up the bottom line, social media is increasingly a self-perpetuating distraction machine. Even though I’m technically on Google, I’m still angry about people’s absurd obsession with a TikTok meme, reacting to the reactions. Our outrage, joy, and nihilism are all high-octane fuel for the attention economy, manufactured by and for our own consumption. Can’t we just take a break, and stop this endless cycle of content farming? It’s a no bones day, after all.</p>

# My nested cross-validation come to Jesus moment

    <p> Tucked away in the last figure of a <a href="https://academic.oup.com/scan/article/15/4/487/5824852">multivoxel pattern analysis review article </a> lies the best visual depiction of nested cross-validation I’ve ever encountered. Behold:</p>

    <div style="clear: both"></div>
    <p> Have you ever seen something so beautiful? Approaching machine learning from a neuroscience background has often left me frustrated as I often feel like I'm missing crucial, simple details that would make everything "click", something I attribute to not taking enough computer science courses during my undergrad. </p>
    <p> With nested-cross validation, I always had questions like: how are hyperparameters evaluated in the inner loop? How do the best hyperparameters get worked back into the outer loop? What is the specific order of operations? </p> 
    <p> This graphic answers all my questions, so I wanted to share. Enjoy. </p>

# Too much mindfulness?
~~~
<div class="row">
  <div class="container">
    <img class="left" src="/assets/meditation.jpg" height=400px>
    <div style="clear: both"></div>
    <p> As someone who has always believed that their life would improve dramatically if only they could find the self-discipline to sit down and meditate for 10 goddamn minutes a day, I was shocked and somewhat amused to read a blog post about the <a href="https://danlawton.substack.com/p/when-buddhism-goes-bad">dangers of too much mindfulness</a>. In it, Dan Lawton documents his experience meditating so deeply that he descended into a ‘hellscape of terror, panic and paranoia,’ an episode so traumatic that it left him with PTSD and a rightful sense of betrayal from the meditation community. How could this happen? I was really banking on Nirvana being more welcoming.</p>
    <p> As it turns out, there’s an upper limit to the benefits you can extract from meditation and mindfulness before you start seeing “side effects”. On his quest for answers, Lawton discovered the recent work of Dr. Willoughby Britton, a psychologist at Brown, who has been warning of the potential dangers of mindfulness for the past decade. She runs “First Do No Harm” trainings for meditation retreat centers, which I can’t imagine is very good PR for them. </p>
    <p>Her work outlines primarily the domains of mindfulness-related practices and how certain people may actually be harmed by taking these on, depending on their baseline psychological characteristics. For instance, interoception, or awareness of the internal body state, is a mindfulness-related skill thought to confer the most benefits from mindfulness (Mehling et al., 2012). Increased interoception resulting from mindfulness has been linked to increases in the activation and cortical thickness of the insular cortex, the primary hub for interoception. Britton points out that increased awareness of your body’s internal sensations is not necessarily a good thing. Are we really recommending everyone should be more in tune with their body’s sensations of hunger, chronic pain, panic? What is the limit? Heightened awareness of arousal is believed to underlie some panic disorders (Clack 1986). Anecdotally, I wouldn’t want to be more in tune with my body’s alertness after I drink too much coffee.</p>    
    <p> I like the idea that mindfulness/meditation should be prescribed to meet a person's needs, and is not a 'cure-all' for everyone. If you're already feeling detached from your emotions, maybe putting more distance between your awareness and your thoughts is not a good thing, and likewise for high baseline self-awareness.</p>
    <p> Someone who copes by numbing out or repressing their emotions might not benefit from further distance between their awareness and their feelings. On the other hand, someone who over-identifies with their emotions to the point of getting lost in them might stand to gain from detachment techniques.</p>
    <p> The story makes me realize that mindfulness & meditation is just another market filled with people who are looking to make a profit, and perhaps there should be more filtering of who would actually benefit from meditation/mindfulness retreats in the way that psychedelic therapies screen against people with family histories of psychosis. </p>
    <p> The major take home for me was that balance, or the 'middle way', as the author puts it, might be the only thing worth striving for.</p>
