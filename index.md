    I am a third year PhD student in the Weill Cornell Medicine Neuroscience department advised by Amy Kuceyeski. I am interested in using neuroimaging to understand and predict recovery from brain injury. Currently, my research is focused on using functional MRI to capture functional plasticity after stroke.
