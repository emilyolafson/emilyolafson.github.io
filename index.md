         I am a PhD candidate at the Weill Cornell Graduate School of Medical Sciences in the department of Neuroscience working in the Computational Connectomics lab (PI: Amy Kuceyeski). I primarily work on applying novel analysis techniques to understand functional imaging correlates of motor recovery after stroke, and developing machine learning models to predict motor outcomes from acute clinical imaging data. I completed my BSc in Neuroscience at McGill University and was an instructor in the Cornell Prison Education Program where I taught Neurochemistry of Human Behavior in NY state prisons. I am originally from Toronto, Canada.
