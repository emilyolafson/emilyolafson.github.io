	test   I am a third year PhD candidate in the Weill Cornell Medicine Neuroscience department advised by Amy Kuceyeski of the <a href="https://www.cocolaboratory.com/">CoCo lab</a>. I am interested in using neuroimaging to understand and predict recovery from brain injury. Currently, my research is focused on using functional MRI to capture functional plasticity after stroke.
